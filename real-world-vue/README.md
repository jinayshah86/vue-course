### Why a CLI?

#### As you probably know, CLI stands for Command Line Interface, and the Vue CLI provides a full system for rapid Vue.js development. This means it does a lot of tedious work for us and provides us with valuable features out-of-the-box.

- It allows us to select which libraries our project will be using Then it automatically plugs them into the project.
- It Configures Webpack When we build our app with Webpack, all of our JavaScript files, our CSS, and our dependencies get properly bundled together, minified and optimized.
- It allows us to write our HTML, CSS & JavaScript however we like We can use single-file .vue components, TypeScript, SCSS, Pug, the latest versions of ECMAScript, etc.
- It enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR) So when you save your project, changes appear instantly in the browser. This configuration is based on webpack-dev-server.
